/// Sizing of a view
/// Usually, the size of a plug-in view is fixed. But both the host and the plug-in can cause
/// a view to be resized:@n - @b Host: If IPlugView::canResize () returns kResultTrue the host will set up the window
/// so that the user can resize it. While the user resizes the window,
/// IPlugView::checkSizeConstraint () is called, allowing the plug-in to change the size to a valid
/// a valid supported rectangle size. The host then resizes the window to this rect and has to call IPlugView::onSize ().@n @n - @b Plug-in: The plug-in can call IPlugFrame::resizeView () and cause the host to resize the
/// window.@n @n Afterwards, in the same callstack, the host has to call IPlugView::onSize () if a resize is needed (size was changed).
/// Note that if the host calls IPlugView::getSize () before calling IPlugView::onSize () (if needed),
/// it will get the current (old) size not the wanted one!!@n Here the calling sequence:@n - plug-in-&gt;host: IPlugFrame::resizeView (newSize)
/// - host-&gt;plug-in (optional): IPlugView::getSize () returns the currentSize (not the newSize!)
/// - host-&gt;plug-in: if newSize is different from the current size: IPlugView::onSize (newSize)
/// - host-&gt;plug-in (optional): IPlugView::getSize () returns the newSize@n &lt;b&gt;Please only resize the platform representation of the view when IPlugView::onSize () is
/// called.&lt;/b&gt;
/// </par>
/// <par>
/// Keyboard handling
/// The plug-in view receives keyboard events from the host. A view implementation must not handle
/// keyboard events by the means of platform callbacks, but let the host pass them to the view. The host
/// depends on a proper return value when IPlugView::onKeyDown is called, otherwise the plug-in view may
/// cause a malfunction of the host's key command handling.
